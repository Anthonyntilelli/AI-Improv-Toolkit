# Ethics FAQ

**Does this replace human performers?**
No. Human performers retain full control. The AI cannot act, speak, or influence a scene without explicit human input.

**Is the AI improvising on its own?**
No. The AI does not initiate content. It responds only when triggered by a human operator.

**Is audience or performer data stored or reused?**
No. Data is show-persistent only and discarded after the performance unless debug mode is explicitly enabled and announced.

**What is debug mode, and when is it used?**
Debug mode enables additional logging for development and testing. It is always announced and never active during Ethics Mode.

**What is Ethics Mode?**
Ethics Mode enforces the use of copyright-respecting AI tools and disables debug functionality to ensure privacy and data minimization.

**Are third-party AI APIs used?**
No. The system does not rely on external conversational AI services. All processing occurs locally or on controlled cloud infrastructure.

**Why use AI at all?**
The project is an optional experiment in augmentation, not a solution to a problem or a replacement for human creativity.

**Can the AI be shut off mid-show?**
Yes. A physical or software kill switch is always available and immediately disables AI output.
